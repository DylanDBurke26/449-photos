                Above is pictured the first time that I had seen someone get a four of a kind in Texas Hold'em. This a very rare hand to get in Hold'em (about 2.1% of the time by time the last card is played). The person with the Q<span class="red">&diamondsuit;</span>, J<span class="red">&heartsuit;</span> felt pretty good when the first three cards came out since they had paired their J<span class="red">&heartsuit;</span> with the J&clubsuit;. The player with the 5&clubsuit;, 5<span class="red">&diamondsuit;</span> felt great since the had made three of a kind fives with the 5&spadesuit;. The next card came out and both players felt even better since the 6&spadesuit; didn't help them and most likely didn't help their oppenent. Then comes the 5<span class="red">&heartsuit;</span>. The player with the Q<span class="red">&diamondsuit;</span>, J<span class="red">&heartsuit;</span> was a little nervous since they thought that the other player could have three of kind with a single 5 in their hand. The 5&clubsuit;, 5<span class="red">&diamondsuit;</span> is feeling giddy since they know that they are going to win the hand. Q<span class="red">&diamondsuit;</span>, J<span class="red">&heartsuit;</span> bets high to scare off the other player, but 5&clubsuit;, 5<span class="red">&diamondsuit;</span> snap raises all in, they flip their cards over and the 5&clubsuit;, 5<span class="red">&diamondsuit;</span> player walks away with a lot of money.
